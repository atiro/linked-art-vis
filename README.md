Convert Linked Art data to visualisation of:

   * Provence
   * Exhibtion

of artworks clustered on a starting Exhibition. 

E.g. FOr Manchester Art Treaures Exhibition:

  * Group artworks around Exhibtion node
  * Cluster those with same owner at the time 
  * Indicate from each artwork each change of ownership (clustering at the end)

Problems:

  - Intermediate ownerships by same owner, how to show without making a tangled web
  - Change in artwork attribution, where to indicate the change
  - Relationship between time and distance,

Ideally a spiderweb with clusters at the edges for current ownership groups


Linked Art Fragments

  - Would allow matching up (link family trees) different fragements. Ideally on same Identifiers but
    as don't exist for Exhibitions/Artworks would have to go on titles
  - User can load in their own data and suggestions made 
  - Platform model - User can keep private their own proveance records or publish them an allow others
    to use. Allows different trees to be created depending on different claims to prov (or lack of).
  - Allows for bringing together different research into prov. to incrementally build a prov. knowledge graph.
  - provkg.vam.ac.uk ? Prov-KG
  - Import/Export sections as Linked Art data
  - Indication per node
     - Source of information
	 - Contested / Alternatives ?


PRoblematic Data

  - Non-unique artworks
  - Change in attribution
  - Desctrubtion
  - Indicating gaps in provenance history
