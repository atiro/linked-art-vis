# Usage

(WARNING - This is all very rough)

Broadly you need to:

  - Create a dataset, at present by handwriting some CSVs (ultimately this should be done for you
    from a source set of data using Linked Art data model

  - Run the generate-data-sammlung.py script against it to create the JSON data structure needed for visualisation

  - Load the Vega code in vis/ into a visualisation viewer (e.g. ObservableHQ) and load the JSON data
